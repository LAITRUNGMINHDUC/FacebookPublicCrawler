# Facebook Public Crawler

Hello everyone,

Thank you for using my quick Facebook Scraping Python template. 
This solution leverages the library that called **facebook_scrapper** of **kevinzg**. 

You can learn more about this package at: https://pypi.org/project/facebook-scraper/

I hope you can use this to develop your understanding in Social Listeners; Marketing; Market Insights; Sentiment Analysis;... and take this at the first step in Data Analytics world.

I decide to share this works to my UFLL Vietnam (Unilever Future Leaders' League) fellows, friends, and you.

Regards, Duc Lai
